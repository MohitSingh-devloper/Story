Hello This is mohit singh .
This file is made with the cmd proompt.
(type nul >file_name.Extesion).

Now it is editing through the cmd Prompt.
copy con Filename.txt
now we gonna do CONTROL+Z to finish it.

Other way to override is echo Text >filename.txt


To create folder:
mkdir Folder name


To Delete folder:
rmdir \s folder name

For seeing hidden files:
dir C: /a:h /b /s
